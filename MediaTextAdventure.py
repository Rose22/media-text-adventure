# A text adventure engine unlike any other.. with background music, dynamic sounds, and eventually even images that enrich the experience.
# It reads from a directory of text files structured in a particular way, and uses that structure as a text adventure experience.
#
# For example: the directory must contain a file named "start". This is the point where you start out.
# The top of it will read [N: road, E: nothing, S: nothing, W: nothing]
# This means that from the start point, the player can travel North, to the road.
# If he does travel to the North, the text adventure engine will read the file "road.txt" and use that to play out the next stage of the adventure.
# The typewriter already makes a sound for every character displayed, which already enhances the feel. Coupled with background music, this becomes a multimedia experience instead of just text that you read.
# Creators can assign custom sounds to every action, by replacing the standard sounds in "sound/" with their own.
# To add background music for a particular area, all the creator needs to do is place a music file in sound/ with the name of the location. For example, "road.mp3"
